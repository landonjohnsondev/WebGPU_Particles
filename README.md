# Explosive Maneuvers
## Project Background
"Explosive Manuevers" is a game I developed with WebGPU in a team with one other member.
It was created as the final project of the Advanced Computer Graphics course.
The game was also presented at the Fall 2025 Florida Poly Game Expo.
The goal of the project was to research WebGPU particle systems, specifically smoke and fire, which were both implemented with raymarching.
Due to the drop in performance from smoke raymarching, only fire is used in the main game, but both fire and smoke are present in the debug level.
The scope of the game was expanded to also include two levels, including a boss level, in addition to the particles.

## How to Play the Game

## Team Contributions
- Landon Johnson - Created both levels, created the fire, created the spike, wall, and floor models, created the main menu, programmed player controls, programmed tnt explosions and crater movement,
- Jasmine Rodriguez - Created the smoke, created the sign model, implemented tnt interacting, implemented randomized flame positions, created the debug scene, and playtested the levels.
